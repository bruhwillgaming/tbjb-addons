WTF is this? It's a tiny addon for the Windows 93 trollbox that provides a bunch of silly, useless chat commands. Use it if you want the chat to spit out stupid shit locally. Yes, it's dumb. Yes, it says words like "wtf", "fuck", "bitch", etc. It's intentionally potty-mouthed and rude — don't use it where that would get you banned.

This addon runs locally in your browser: TBJB messages are printed locally with the nick `TBJB` in green. Normal messages that don't start with a slash (`/`) are sent to the server as usual. Some commands make your own nick send a message (for example `/drunk`).

Commands
--------

- `/wtf` — shows a TBJB message that says `$(black)$[white]wtf`
- `/drunk` — replaces your outgoing message with: `im drunk` (sent as you)
- `/dance` — TBJB: "does an extremely awkward little dance. 💃🕺"
- `/dance2` — TBJB: "does a slow robot shuffle. 🤖"
- `/shrug` — TBJB: `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- `/flip` — TBJB: `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`
- `/unflip` — TBJB: `┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)`
- `/fortune` — TBJB: random useless fortune
- `/cow` — TBJB: tiny cow ASCII
- `/ping` — TBJB: fake latency pong
- `/roll [max]` — TBJB: roll a die (default 6). Example: `/roll 20`
- `/echo <text>` — TBJB: repeats your text reversed
- `/lenny` — TBJB: `( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)`
- `/boop` — TBJB: `boop! *boop* (you were gently booped)`
- `/hug` — TBJB: `hugs you. 🤗`
- `/compliment` — TBJB: gives a random silly compliment
- `/yodel` — TBJB: `Yodel-ay-hee-hoo! 🎵`
- `/nom` — TBJB: `nom nom nom (delicious imaginary snack)`
- `/sneeze` — TBJB: `*Achoo!* Gesundheit!`
- `/8ball <question>` — TBJB: magic 8-ball answer
- `/asciiheart` — TBJB: tiny ASCII heart
- `/sing` — TBJB: sings a nonsense lyric
- `/glasses` — TBJB: `puts on their finest pixel glasses. 🤓`
- `/spitball` — TBJB: `spitball flicked! It missed by a mile.`
- `/stare` — TBJB: `*stares silently into the void*`
- `/snek` — TBJB: `~<:3 )~~`

Usage
-----

1. Place this file as `README.md` at the repo root (or replace the existing README).
2. Put `commands.js` (the addon) into your Windows 93 trollbox addons folder or update the repo file.
3. Reload the addons in the trollbox and open your browser console (F12) to watch for errors.
4. Use commands starting with a slash (`/`). Non-slash messages are sent normally.

Warnings
--------

- This addon emits profanity and rude phrases (wtf, fuck, bitch, etc.). It's meant for private, silly use only.
- TBJB messages are local-only (they do not get sent to the server) except for commands that explicitly set the outgoing message (currently `/drunk`).
- Don't use this where profanity or trolling might get you banned — use responsibly.
